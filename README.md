### Deployment (GitHub Pages)

- This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the presentation and publishes it to GitHub Pages on pushes to the `main` branch.
- After the push you did, the site should be available at:

  - Project page: https://Geilevideossos.github.io/DIC-Pr-si

  (If you used a different repository name, replace the repo segment accordingly.)

- If the site does not appear immediately, check the repository's **Actions** tab to verify the workflow ran successfully and **Settings → Pages** for the published source. The first deployment can take a few minutes.
